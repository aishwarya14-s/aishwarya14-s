<p>We all know education is important and fetches us respect in the society. 
Education has a lot of benefits. An educated person is an asset to the society that will help the country grow. 
It gives us positivity that helps us have a better lifestyle.
Education is really more important for the younger generation as they hold the responsibility of the tomorrow’s society.
Let’s first break down the word ‘Education’. It’s not just going to school or reading books. 
It is a way of life that teaches time management, patience, how to dwell with others and most importantly, ethics. 
Lucky are the kids who get the opportunity of having education as 60 lakh children in India are still out-of-school (there are many reasons, poverty being one of them).
</p> Child labor is one big reason where lack of money forces children to work when they deserve to wear a school uniform.
