<h3>In 1999, the  centre was established in Bangalore as a response to the high rate of drop-outs in the urban community. 
SPARKS traced this down to factors such as poor foundational skills, lack of access to quality teaching, safe infrastructure or even nutritious meals. 
An empty stomach never devoured much knowledge!
We set up a safe space for providing quality academic engagement to academically weak students (grades 1-10) from BPL families providing them remedial education support along with nutritious mid-day meals, health camps and regular counselling sessions.
Our successes in SPARKS became a foundation for our nationwide programmes and the flagship school now serves as a laboratory for continued programme development.
8.1 million children need help to stay in school. 
These are the children whom education has passed by. These are the children whom we dream will, one day, all have access to schooling. 
Are these numbers daunting? Yes, perhaps. Yet, to us, transforming these numbers is what drives us each morning. 
Established in 1999 by cricket icon Kapil Dev, SPARKS works tirelessly to keep children in school, through holistic interventions that impact the community. 
In just 17 years, SPARKS has transformed the lives of over 1.5 million women and children.</h3>
